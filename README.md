# 72 Hour Project

- Utilizing team git, create a React application.
- When your application first runs, it needs to grab and store your location. 
- With the location, fire off GET requests to three (3) separate api’s.

NASA: https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/earth/imagery

Open Weather: https://openweathermap.org/current (Links to an external site.)

Ticketmaster: https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/ (Links to an external site.)

- Based on your location, from the NASA Earth api grab a satellite image matching your location, the weather in your current location, and events nearest your location.
- Additionally, add a button that toggles between Fahrenheit and Centigrade when pulling from the weather api.
- Use Material UI, Reactstrap, or styled components to style out the project however your team decides. 

## Requirements:

The application must pull data from the NASA, Open Weather, and Ticketmaster's API's and present it to the DOM

## Presentation:

Your team will present this project as a group on Tuesday, September 23rd. 
 
## How to Proceed:

This is a great way to get to know your team, as well as decide how your work patterns will function. We encourage you to start this project with a plan. Think about what the application is asking for, and try to scaffold out a  Project Tree. Then some wireframes, and a Trello board. Trello is a tool teams of developers use to create tickets(things that need to get done)  and separate them into lists like Need To Do, In Progress,  and Done. Here's a sample of how a development team could implement a Trello Board (Links to an external site.).  This link takes you to a template. Before starting your project, create a board from this template and start scaffolding out the various tasks this project requires.  Taking the time to plan these steps out will help save headache in the future when your team begins to code! 

Note:  The Learning Team and Learning Gym will not be available to assist you during this project. Your team is your main source of assistance. The #peer-help channel in Slack is still available, but the Learning Team will not be commenting or assisting on posts pertaining to your 72 Hour Project.

Finally, don’t lose sight of the 50,000 ft. view of why you are doing what you’re doing. You’re learning, it’s going to be messy, but that’s all a part of the fun.
